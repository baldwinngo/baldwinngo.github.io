title: QRP CW Transceiver

Many hams are familiar with QRP radios because of their low power usage. After reading up on QRP radios and their construction, it piqued my interest. Mostly because I wouldn't need a car battery to run on. 

Most QRP radios operate under 10 watts, some even under 5 watts. Though the designation of what defines a low power QRP radio is in the air because some hams say under 100 watts qualify.

My goal was to build a QRP radio that uses less than 10 watts. 

This was my first DIY radio project, so it wasn't good. It probably would've been best to start off with a standard 100 watt radio. I can't disagree, but I like to take things in the most roundabout way possible.

I took lots of inspiration from [ludens.cl](http://ludens.cl/Electron/pqd5/PQD5.html). Unfortunately, I couldn't copy just copy the entire schematic because there were a couple parts that were too hard to find (namely some old IC's and variable capacitors). 

Though, the block diagram was helpful and
