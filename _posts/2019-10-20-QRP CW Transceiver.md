title: QRP CW Transceiver

Many hams are familiar with QRP radios because of their low power usage. After reading up on QRP radios and their construction, it piqued my interest. Mostly because I won't need a car battery to run on. 

Most QRP radios operate under 10 watts, some even under 5 watts. Though the designation of what defines a low power QRP radio is in the air because some hams say under 100 watts qualify.

My goal is to build a QRP radio that uses less than 10 watts. 

This will be my first DIY radio project, so it likely won't be good. There will probably be a lot of backlash for starting off in HF with a QRP radio; it'd probably be best to start off with a standard 100 watt radio. I can't disagree, but I like to take things in the most roundabout way possible.

I will be taking lots of inspiration from
