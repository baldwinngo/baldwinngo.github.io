title: Coat Hangers and NOAA Satellites
---

I've been meaning to gather weather images from satellites for a while now, ever since I've watched Thought Emporium's video on it. 

Last night, I built my first antenna using two coat hangers and some RG6 coax. The design is crude at best, but it worked for my purposes. I tested the antenna on FM radio stations using SDR#, and it was magnitudes better in gain than the tiny monopole antenna that came with the RTL.

I meant to capture NOAA 19 this morning because it supposed had the best elevation (almost directly above me), but I slept through my alarm. The next best pass was the NOAA 18 in the afternoon. 

My first recording was incredibly noisy. It probably did not help
